Umbraco is a content management system created by Niels Hartvig and is headquartered in the Scandinavian country of Denmark.  Umbraco is an open-source software project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/).  It is updated often and embodies some of the latest web technologies and methodologies.  It has evolved through the years and this book specifically deals with version 7.

##Umbraco 7 features at a glance##
* The backend is mainly built on .NET C# MVC.  There are some leftovers of web forms still in the core, but they are being weeded out.
* The frontend is powered by Google's AngularJS.  Umbraco has a robust set of directives, services and resources which make extending functionality easy.
* Support for SQL CE and MSSQL is robust.  There is also some support for MySQL.
* Umbraco can host a single website or several.
* There is support for caching and load-balancing.
* Umbraco has a built-in search support using Examine which is a .NET port of the Apache Lucene search engine.
* Umbraco development is like standard .NET MVC development with the benefit of a CMS to provide management tools.
* Umbraco has a huge and helpful community that regularly create add-ons and help answer questions.
* Umbraco follows many convention over configuration patterns.
* Umbraco tends to provide default functionality with the ability to override it.
* The core is open-source and is hosted on GitHub.  Umbraco developers regularly contribute to the core.

##Open-Source isn't scary##
Open-source software used to be cast in a negative light due to many reasons.  However Umbraco proves that OSS can be very innovative and can implement positive change in short order.

Umbraco is very fast-paced and you can expect patch updates regularly and new features often.  Umbraco has gone through many major versions, but version 7 is in a class of it's own.
