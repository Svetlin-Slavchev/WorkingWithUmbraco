#Visual Studio Express#

Visual Studio is the essential tool you will need to compile C# code into dll's. Don't buy into the hype that developing .NET has to cost you an arm and a leg. In fact, Visual Studio Express is free and will handle all of the things you need to be able to do in this book.

Of course Microsoft does offer paid versions of Visual Studio and you may find some of the features well worth the cost.  Here is a link to compare the different paid versions: https://www.visualstudio.com/products/compare-visual-studio-products-vs.  At this time though the Express edition doesn't show on the chart.  One of the biggest drawbacks to Express is you can't use Visual Studio plugins like ReSharper.  Otherwise you can build a commerical app for free.
