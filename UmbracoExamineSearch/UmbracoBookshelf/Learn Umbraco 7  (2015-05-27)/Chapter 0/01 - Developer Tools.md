This book is about extending Umbraco and extending Umbraco can be simple and it can be advanced for those who choose to do so.  Therefore depending on what you wish to accomplish, it may not require anything special.

##Required Tools##
###A good text editor###
If you are simply looking to add some custom data types to your build of Umbraco, you will only need your text editor of choice such as [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

###Visual Studio Express or higher###
If you plan on extending functionality of the backoffice that requires custom server side code, you will want to download and use Microsoft Visual Studio.  Fear not, the Express versions of VS are free to use and are very capable.  Please consult the appendix for [installing Visual Studio Express](/z-Appendix B - Installing Visual Studio Express/README.md).

Things requiring custom server side code:
* Custom trees and sections
* Integration with Umbraco content that is not offered via an Umbraco web service
* Handling custom forms
* Programmatically create/import content
* Custom database queries
* Capturing and modifying default behavior through event handling (like running code before or after a publish)

*Please check documentation and Google for what you are trying to accomplish.  There are many things Umbraco already provides.*

##Optional Tools##
For the uber nerds, you will probably want to get these tools:

* [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) - ReSharper takes code hinting and completion to the next level.  *May not be installable on VS Express.*
* [GitExtensions](https://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/) - A GUI that helps with common Git commands.
* [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) - A free tool to watch HTTP transactions happen in real-time.
