#Git Extensions#

Git Extensions is a free tool that helps users (new and old) operate their local Git repos.  You can download it [here](https://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/).  Installation may seem daunting, but please read each of the installation panels and when in doubt, just take the defaults.  By installing Git Extensions, you are also installing Git itself which is required if you want to actually *use* Git.

##Why use Git Extensions?##
Git Extensions visualizes you commit history and provides a GUI to perform many of the command line interface (CLI) functions.  Many developers use Git Extensions in a hybrid way meaning they use the GUI for some things and using CLI commands for other things.

Git Extensions excels at graphically showing which files have changed and which lines have changed within them.  It has a great UI to stage your files as your choosing what you want to commit.
