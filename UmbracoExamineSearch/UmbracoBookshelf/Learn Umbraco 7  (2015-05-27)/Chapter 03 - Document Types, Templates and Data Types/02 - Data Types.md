##Data Types##
Data types are the rendered *controls* that editors will use to input their data into Umbraco.  They are managed via the `Developer->Data Types` section of the backoffice.

Data types in the tree are instances of a particular type of data type.  For instance you can configure one or more dropdowns with distinct values.  The values that are configured at this level of a data type are known as `Prevalues`.

Out of the box are most of the data types you will ever need.  However Umbraco is very easy to extend and allows custom data types to be created or added.

Some data types allow for nesting of data structures such as other data types and other document types.  Be sure to visit http://our.umbraco.org for some killer packages.

For more information regarding core data types, please refer to the official documentation.
