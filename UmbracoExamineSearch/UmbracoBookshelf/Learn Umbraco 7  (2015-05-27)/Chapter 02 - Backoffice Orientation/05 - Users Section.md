#Users Section#

The users section is where you'll manage users who are meant to log into the Umbraco backoffice.  These are different types of users from `members` which are persons who login to the frontend.

##User Management##

Add, modify or disable users by selecting `Users` in the tree.  Note that you cannot delete users due to audit trail reasons.

Each user will need at a minimum:

*Username
*Login
*Content Start Node
*Media Start Node
*Sections

This screen determines which sections are available to users.  Most non-admins will only need access to `Content` and `Media`.

##User Types##
Here you can setup default context menu load outs that can then be selected in the `Users` screen per user.

##User Permissions##
Restrict access on a per node/user basis.
