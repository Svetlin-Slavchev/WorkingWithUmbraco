###What is it?###
This package creates a tree for all of the `~/App_Data/Logs` files so that you access the log without connecting to the server and downloading them.

###Why should I use it?###
It's extremely useful for production boxes where access to the box may not be easily accomplished.  It's color-coded and searchable.
