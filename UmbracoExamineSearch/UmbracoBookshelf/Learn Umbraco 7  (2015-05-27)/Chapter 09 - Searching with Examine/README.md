Umbraco comes with a built-in search engine powered by [Examine](https://github.com/Shazwazza/Examine) that can search both the backoffice and frontend.  Examine is a .NET port of the [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) search engine from the Apache Foundation.  It provides an incredible search engine that automatically indexes your content.
