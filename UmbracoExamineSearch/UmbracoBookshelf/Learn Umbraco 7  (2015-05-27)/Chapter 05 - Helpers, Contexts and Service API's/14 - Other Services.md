#Other Services#

There are a few other services that are accessible from the server.  Some of these aren't used often in the C# context but rather by proxy from AngularJs services. The other services are:

* `ApplicationTreeService`
* `SectionService`
* `EntityService`
* `LocalizationService`
* `MacroService`
* `NotificationService`
* `PackagingService`
* `RelationService`
* `TagService`
* `TextService`
* `UserService`

All of these services are accessible the same way are the other services are.  For more information on these services, please consult the official documentation.
