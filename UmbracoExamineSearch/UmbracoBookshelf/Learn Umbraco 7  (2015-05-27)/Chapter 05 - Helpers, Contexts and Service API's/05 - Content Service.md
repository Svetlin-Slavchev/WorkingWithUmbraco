#ContentService#

Content service is an API interface for manipulating content.  Specifically `ContentService` works with the `IContent` class.

>Please do not use `ContentService` for simple reads or getting of node content.  Please use the `IPublishedContent` mechanisms for that.

`ContentService` is best used to create, move, sort, update backoffice data programmatically.

Please see a simple demonstration in the [IContent Section](/Chapter 04 - Get and Set Content Programattically in Umbraco/02 - IContent.md).
