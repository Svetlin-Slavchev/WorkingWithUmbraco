Node.js is server-side javascript that can be used for a variety of reasons.  For the purposes of this book, Node.js is being used to execute repetitive code (tasks) that make life easier for a developer.

##Install##
To install, simply go to https://nodejs.org/ and install the version for your environment.  Use the defaults (in most cases) and ensure it gets added to your `path` windows environment variable.

Reboot your machine.

##Grunt##
Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/) is a task runner to be used with Node.js which is all javascript.

To install, run `npm install -g grunt-cli` after you've installed Node.js.

Node Package Manager (npm) is what actually installs Grunt and is shipped with Node.js
